#lookml-for-salesforce

#Overview

**lookml-for-salesforce** is a set of LookML files for use with the [Simple Data Pipe](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe/) example app that deploys to the [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net) platform service. The Simple Data Pipe easily moves data from different online sources into IBM’s JSON database service, [Cloudant](https://cloudant.com/). With data landed in Cloudant in its native structure, users can then consolidate data in their own warehouses or analytics tools. (In this case, users will want to use Cloudant's native integration with [dashDB](http://dashdb.com), IBM's cloud data warehouse.)

LookML is a data modeling language for the [Looker](http://www.looker.com/) business intelligence platform. With LookML, BI analysts can describe their data and apply business rules in a higher-level language that Looker converts down to SQL. It hooks right into your warehouse and is great at powering Web dashboards and data exploration.

Below, you’ll find a set of files that deals with [Salesforce.com](http://www.salesforce.com/) (SFDC) data. We’ve written all the LookML for you, and we designed it to solve some of the most common analytics and reporting tasks when warehousing SFDC data. Independent of the data pipe application, Looker customers can use this LookML in their own projects.

##Prerequisites

* A Looker instance or [free trial account](http://www.looker.com/free-trial)
* Access to a SFDC account with admin permissions
* A data movement/ETL tool
* A database (or warehouse) loaded with data
	* Optional: If you plan to deploy our Simple Data Pipe application, [sign up](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/) for an IBM Bluemix account (30-day free trial). See [our tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe/) for instructions on deploying.

##How it works

1. Fork this repository into your own GitHub account.
	* If you customize your LookML to handle proprietary information, you should consider purchasing a private GitHub repository.
2. Install LookML for Salesforce data.
	* Create a Looker database connection. (Looker [docs](http://www.looker.com/docs/admin/admin-settings/create-db-connection).)
	* Create a new Looker project. (Looker [docs](http://www.looker.com/docs/admin/admin-settings/manage-projects#configured-projects).)
	* Configure Git for your project to connect to your looker-for-pipes fork. (Looker [forum](https://discourse.looker.com/t/how-to-configure-git-in-looker-3-18/623).)
	* ([Our tutorial](https://developer.ibm.com/clouddataservices/simple-data-pipe/#setup-Looker-dashDB) steps through this process, with the database connection configured for dashDB.)
3. View your data
	* Access the SFDC dashboard by selecting _Spaces / LookML Dashboards_.
	* Or _Explore_ your data, where your can add or subtract dimensions and measures.

##Need Assistance?

If you have any questions about the technical implementation of Simple Data Pipe or IBM dashDB, ask us on stackoverflow using #SimpleDataPipe

Should you choose to deploy the Simple Data Pipe sample web application, be aware that it includes code to track deployments to Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/cloudant-labs/deployment-tracker) service on each deployment:

* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)

This data is collected from the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.
